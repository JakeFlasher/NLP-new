One defintion of idiot in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is:

""a foolish or stupid person""

So, relative to firing Comey, Trump was both stupid and foolish.  Evidence?  Mueller, Bannon and general ongoing controversy.

Relative to new smear campaign against Comey?  Stupid and foolish.  The talkiing points miss the pint, but more importantly, they re-raise how stupid and foolish he was to fire Comey in the first place.  Lester Holt's interview gets more views on Youtube.

Plus, just overall, he's stupid and foolish.  So, idiot.  And, also idiotic.  For his idiotness (A word?  You can criticize if not)."

You are right IMO that Andrew gave a crackerjack speech on Friday especially in his attacks on The Clown Prince.

Probably Scheer will get even better sharpening his attacks on Trudeau  and this is vital to success in 2019 since the media will mostly continue to give Justin a free pass and since the popularity of the Liberal government is pretty much all Trudeau and his celebrity.

A flat economy in 2019, more moronic and embarrassing behaviour by Trudeau, a huge accumulated debt,  more broken promises and at least a modest revival of the NDP will make the Liberals vulnerable.

Assuming voters decide they want change and conclude the PM has failed to meet expectations, a strong campaign by Scheer will bring victory.

Clearly the content of your ""commentary"" (more like a slogan) and styling are an indication of insanity. That's how liberals deal with the world, they shoot themselves in the foot, time and time again. 

Liberals support ""race politics""  and so close the door on rational debate. Politics becomes a football for racialists and revolutionaries calculating redress and measuring imbalance. Liberals practice birth control, which ensures they will not spread their luciferian doctrines beyond this benighted generation. Liberals thrive on the largess of a functioning society, so of course they do what they can to undermine and dismantle the very civilization that tolerates them.

Liberalism is a disease of the wealthy and idle elites, much as Enlightenment was the disease that spelled doom for the Middle Ages. Every civilization has a healthy ascendancy and a sickly decline. Liberalism is our swan song."

He was described on the programme by people who knew him - devoid of human empathy, utterly ruthless. One person said they certainly experienced evil when in his presence. Decent business people (and some not so decent) wouldn't touch him with a barge-pole.

What they found most disturbing was that Trump met him then told his people, ""I want that guy working for me.""

They also showed Trump in an interview stating that 'Its all about genes."" It was like interviewing someone from the Third Reich.

Anti-Catholic and anti-French attitude drew its source, among others, the fact that many of the Loyalists who came to Québec after the American Revolution of 1775 (Eastern Townships/ Ontario and Western Provinces) were ""Orangemen"" convinced.  Orangemen advocated an anti-Catholic and anti-French doctrine, inspired by the reconquest of England in 1690 by the Protestant Prince William III of Orange.…
