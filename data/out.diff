> For example, Cheeto Hitler has repeatedly described his victory over Hillary Clinton as a “historic” and “massive” landslide. That’s not the case. His Electoral College victory actually ranks 46th out of 58 presidential elections. He lost the popular vote to Clinton by about 2.8 million votes.  That's hardly “historic” and the furthest thing from “massive.” This is a flat-out lie, even if you allow a little embellishment for the sake of a good story.

< Donald Trump is a full-blown, unequivocal LIAR. His leadership of the ""birther"" movement alone earns him that label, which might as well be tattooed across his forehead. His serial lies about the ex-President's birthplace were debunked almost immediately, yet he willfully and continually repeated that false information, to his own benefit, for years. When, at the final moment of truth, he was asked to defend or refute his lies, he gave the wimpiest response possible, neither admitting to his lies nor defending his point.

A Pope who is called ""a goddamn socialist"" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating ""economic Americhristianity"", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel.

Though his piece aims at the exploitation of fear, I think his reasoning can also be applied to the realm of economy and economic justice (btw: does anyone, including Ms. Slade, remember that great prophetic letter by the US Bishops, ""Economic Justice For All"", from November 1986?). A Pope who is called ""a goddamn socialist"" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating ""economic Americhristianity"", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel. Maybe Pope Francis needs to make an authoritative statement to that effect, in form of an Encyclical, written in English. Title: ""With Grave Concern"" (respectful thanks to Pius XI)."
