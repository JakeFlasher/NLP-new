How many more needless deaths in Syria would you like to see before we can  finally put an end to this?  Or are you one of those who supports hospital bombings?

The real question is why do you insist on sticking your head in the sand and pretending everything is tickety-boo in the world today?  By the way, that's exactly the type of thing which Neville Chamberlain advocated and did before WW2 and we all saw how that situation ending up getting resolved.  

History is doomed to be repeated when fools like yourself ignore what's happening.  I'm not suggesting another World War, but under no circumstances should this Syrian Civil War ever have gotten to the point it is today... especially if Obama and his administration had exhibited the backbone to act decisively back in 2012."

Thus, they're more likely to be stopped for something and have a rap sheet once a drug charge comes along.""

Vaughn also seems to conveniently forget that Germany is a country in which over 22% of residents are not born in Germany. This fact completely and utterly destroys the writer's claims about inherent German xenophobia.

Vaughn's attempts to ground current German attitudes and behavior in Prussia and the Soviet occupation is like me trying to say that Canadians love to travel because of Canada's experience in the fur trade; or saying that Canadians are anti-American because of the war of 1812. Just plain stupid.

Then says he did not read it, but he gave it to Comey.   Really?  Now, I know that is true that he gave it to Comey, but I kind of think he read it.  Don't you?.  Why tip toe around this.  I also thought it was said that Jeb Bush may have contributed money toward the dosier before he dropped out.  After the inevitability of the nomination, I think Democrats for Clinton paid toward it.

Clearly the content of your ""commentary"" (more like a slogan) and styling are an indication of insanity. That's how liberals deal with the world, they shoot themselves in the foot, time and time again. 

Liberals support ""race politics""  and so close the door on rational debate. Politics becomes a football for racialists and revolutionaries calculating redress and measuring imbalance. Liberals practice birth control, which ensures they will not spread their luciferian doctrines beyond this benighted generation. Liberals thrive on the largess of a functioning society, so of course they do what they can to undermine and dismantle the very civilization that tolerates them.

Liberalism is a disease of the wealthy and idle elites, much as Enlightenment was the disease that spelled doom for the Middle Ages. Every civilization has a healthy ascendancy and a sickly decline. Liberalism is our swan song."

He was described on the programme by people who knew him - devoid of human empathy, utterly ruthless. One person said they certainly experienced evil when in his presence. Decent business people (and some not so decent) wouldn't touch him with a barge-pole.

What they found most disturbing was that Trump met him then told his people, ""I want that guy working for me.""

They also showed Trump in an interview stating that 'Its all about genes."" It was like interviewing someone from the Third Reich.

Anti-Catholic and anti-French attitude drew its source, among others, the fact that many of the Loyalists who came to Québec after the American Revolution of 1775 (Eastern Townships/ Ontario and Western Provinces) were ""Orangemen"" convinced.  Orangemen advocated an anti-Catholic and anti-French doctrine, inspired by the reconquest of England in 1690 by the Protestant Prince William III of Orange.…
